Job Placement Analysis System:

This program analyzes 100,000 datapoints acorss 10,000 studetns. A Red-Black Tree and Hash Map are used to compare loading times and efficiencies. As the project is continued after submission, we will implement more statistical features, including analyzing data of Students placed in jobs to see what students should aim for statistically to be given favorable chances.


This project is simply ran from the terminal/console or your IDE or choice of running the C++ code. Make sure you have all files within the repository mainly what's included in the (main.cpp)src folder, and the college student placement csv file as well as the Makelists text file.. The program will only run if it can access the csv file from within the data folder. You're presented with menu options when the program is ran, the default data structure is Red-Black Tree but you must load the dataset regardless. You will be shown the time to load and then you need to select a student with option 2 and integers 1-1000. Use the other options to learn about that student. To see the time it takes to load using the Hash Map instead, input 13 and reload the set. The same information will be shown.
